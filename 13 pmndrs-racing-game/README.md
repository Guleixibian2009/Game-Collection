Live demo (current state): https://racing.pmnd.rs/

This project is a showcase for the feasibility of React in gaming. Every thing is a self contained component using [react-three-fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber) to express threejs with React semantics. If that seems strange to you read [this explanation](https://twitter.com/0xca0a/status/1282999626782650368).

This project is 100% open source and community built, CC0 assets only, everyone is invited to participate. If you have a PR merged you are added to the triage team. Refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
