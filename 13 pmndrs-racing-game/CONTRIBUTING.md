# Contributing to Racing Game

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Getting Started

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase and we actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and branch from `main`.
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Push changes to your fork
6. Open a PR in our [repository](https://github.com/pmndrs/racing-game/pulls)

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/pmndrs/racing-game/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/pmndrs/racing-game/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can! [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
